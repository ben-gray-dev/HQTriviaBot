Introduction:
============
PyTesser is an Optical Character Recognition module for Python. It takes 
as input an image or image file and outputs a string.

PyTesser uses the Tesseract OCR engine (an Open Source project at Google), 
converting images to an accepted format and calling the Tesseract 
executable as an external script. A Windows executable is provided 
along with the Python scripts. The scripts should work in Linux as well.
